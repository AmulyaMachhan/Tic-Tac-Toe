# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to choose whether to play as "X" or "O" and to select the difficulty level between easy and hard. In the game, players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol. The game provides visual feedback for the current player's turn and announces the winner or a draw when the game ends.
